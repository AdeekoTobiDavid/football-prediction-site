			 <p>By Ben Agande Kaduna – Former Vice President, Abubakar Atiku, Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State

			<p>However, while Atiku Abubakar and Tambuwal spoke about how the present structure of the country could 
			be tinkered with, Prof Abdullahi wanted regionalism or outright break up of the country. The trio spoke at
			a two day conference on “The North and the Future of Nigerian Federation”, organized by the Arewa Research
			and Development Project, in collaboration with Sir Ahmadu Bello Foundation; the Northern Elders Forum; Arewa
			Consultative Forum; Code Group; Northern Delegates Forum; Arewa Reawakening; Jamiyar Matan Arewa and Forum for
			Northern Youths Organisations. While Atiku said the north was not afraid of restructuring because it stood to 
			gain more if more power was devolved to the federating units, Governor Tambuwal, who is also the chairman of Northern
			Governors and Traditional Rulers Committee on Restructuring, said to show that the north had nothing to fear about
			restructuring, northern governors and traditional rulers forum had set up a committee to aggregate the views of the
			north on the issue. Prof Ango Abdullahi on his part, said restructuring should mean a return to the regions as they existed in 1960.</p><br />
